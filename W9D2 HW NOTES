The root node of this tree is the document object, upon which you've called methods like 
document.getElementById() and document.createElement().

Every object in the DOM tree is a Node

Some Nodes aren't HTML elements, such as the plain text you might put inside a p or span (Text),
<!-- comments --> (Comment), and document (Document).
